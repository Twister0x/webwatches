              You will receive your order anywhere from 14-20 business days from
              the date that it is shipped out (if you choose free shipping),<b>
                not necessarily from the date that it is placed</b
              >. After your payment is authorized and verified, it can still
              take up to two days to process your order. This is just an
              estimate, though, and doesn't include weekends or holidays. Orders
              are processed within 1-2 business days after your purchase is made
              (excluding weekends).

              Our free shipping options are sent by the USPS and are eventually
              placed into your country's local postal stream. All customs,
              taxes, import duties, brokerage fees, or any additional charges by
              your local government are the
              <b> responsibility of the recipient.</b> There is a slight chance
              that you will not get charged VAT or duties, however if you do get
              charged, we cannot be responsible for these fees in any way, as we
              do not receive any of this money. The funds go exclusively to your
              own government. The last thing we would want is for our customers
              to be charged extra, as this would be detrimental to our sales.
              Since duties and taxes vary by country and by what was ordered, we
              are not able to supply an estimated cost. Please contact your
              customs office for more information. <br /><br />
              Shipping fees and taxes will not be refunded for packages that are
              refused due to VAT/duties.

          <p class="policytext">
            Any brand new product can be returned for a full refund or store
            credit within 60 days of delivery. We offer free and easy returns
            for all of our customers, domestic and international for orders over
            $50.00. Please contact Customer Support to schedule the return and
            receive a prepaid return label. Expedited shipping charges are
            non-refundable.
            <br />
            <br />
            For international customers with orders under $50.00, the customer
            is responsible for the return shipping. Once we receive it back and
            verify it is unworn, the return will be processed and a full refund
            will be issued.
